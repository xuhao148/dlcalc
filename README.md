# DLCALC

This is a hobby project I made several months ago that works as a calculator. Its behavior resembles a common calculator model used by grocery stores etc. in China. The program runs on Classic Mac OS (tested on 6.0 thru 9.2) and uses
QuickDraw to draw the UI. It is based on FSM with 17 states.
